/* Question 1
Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Output: 
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.

*/

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    cinema
WHERE
    id % 2 != 0
        AND LOWER(description) != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC;


/*

+----------+------------+--------+----------+--------+
Output: 
+------+
| name |
+------+
| Amy  |
| Mark |
| Alex |
+------+
Explanation: 
According to orders 3 and 4 in the Orders table, it is easy to tell that only salesperson John and Pam have sales to company RED, so we report all the other names in the table salesperson.

*/
SELECT 
    name
FROM
    salesperson
WHERE
    sales_id NOT IN (SELECT 
            sales_id
        FROM
            orders
        WHERE
            com_id IN (SELECT 
                    com_id
                FROM
                    company
                WHERE
                    LOWER(name) LIKE '%red%'));
